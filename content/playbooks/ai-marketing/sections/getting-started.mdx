        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <strong>Three years ago</strong>, a CMO at a mid-sized fashion retailer sent their content team to write 50 product descriptions for a new collection. <strong>Budget: $3,000. Timeline: 2 weeks.</strong> Result: Decent copy, delivered on time, but the team was exhausted.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <strong>Last month</strong>, that same CMO generated 200 product descriptions in 90 minutes using AI. <strong>Cost: $47</strong> in tool subscriptions. <strong>Quality: Better than the originals.</strong> The team? They spent those 2 weeks designing a personalization strategy that increased conversion by 23%.
        </p>

      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-3">
        But here's the thing: that CMO didn't wake up one day and magically know how to do this. They had questions. They made mistakes. They tested, failed, adjusted, and eventually built a system that works.

  <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 pb-3 border-b border-gray-200">🚀 AI Marketing in 2025: The Context</h2>
  <div className="space-y-4">
    <Toggle title="What Is AI Marketing? (And Why Definitions Matter)" level={2}>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        Let's clear up some confusion because your CEO, your CTO, and your newest intern probably all mean different things when they say "AI."
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> is the umbrella term for machines performing tasks that typically require human intelligence—learning, problem-solving, pattern recognition, decision-making.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        But in marketing, we're really talking about <strong>three specific types</strong>:
      </p>

      <div className="space-y-4">
        <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-5">
          <h5 className="font-semibold text-brevo-green mb-2">1. Machine Learning (ML) — The Pattern Finder</h5>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-3">
            This is the technology that's been around for a decade. It analyzes historical data to predict future outcomes.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm font-semibold mb-2">Examples in marketing:</p>
          <ul className="text-sm space-y-1 text-gray-600 ml-4">
            <li>• "Customers who bought this also bought..." (Amazon)</li>
            <li>• Predictive lead scoring (Salesforce)</li>
            <li>• Email send-time optimization (Mailchimp)</li>
            <li>• Programmatic ad bidding</li>
            <li>• Churn prediction models</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-3">
            <strong>What it does:</strong> ML looks at thousands of past examples and says, "Based on pattern X, outcome Y is likely." It's excellent at optimization and prediction but doesn't create anything new.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2">
            Your team probably uses ML already without realizing it—it's baked into most marketing platforms.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-brevo-cream border-l-4 border-brevo-green rounded-lg p-5">
          <h5 className="font-semibold text-brevo-green mb-2">2. Generative AI (GenAI) — The Creator ⭐</h5>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-dark font-semibold mb-2">This is the revolution.</p>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">
            GenAI doesn't just predict; it creates new content from scratch—text, images, video, code, music.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm font-semibold mb-2">Examples in marketing:</p>
          <ul className="text-sm space-y-1 text-gray-700 ml-4">
            <li>• ChatGPT writing blog posts, ad copy, email sequences</li>
            <li>• Midjourney/DALL-E generating product images, ad creatives</li>
            <li>• Runway creating video ads from text prompts</li>
            <li>• ElevenLabs cloning voices for personalized audio ads</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-3">
            <strong>What it does:</strong> GenAI learns from billions of examples and generates original content that follows patterns but is unique. It's like having a creative team member who never sleeps, never has writer's block, and can work in 50 languages simultaneously.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm font-bold text-brevo-green mt-2">
            This is what changed everything in 2023-2024 and why your boss suddenly cares about AI.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-5">
          <h5 className="font-semibold text-brevo-green mb-2">3. Predictive AI — The Fortune Teller</h5>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-3">
            This uses ML to forecast specific marketing outcomes with increasing accuracy.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm font-semibold mb-2">Examples in marketing:</p>
          <ul className="text-sm space-y-1 text-gray-600 ml-4">
            <li>• Customer lifetime value prediction</li>
            <li>• Campaign performance forecasting</li>
            <li>• Budget allocation optimization</li>
            <li>• Inventory planning based on demand signals</li>
            <li>• Next-best-action recommendations</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-3">
            <strong>What it does:</strong> It helps you make smarter decisions by showing you probable futures based on current data.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div className="bg-brevo-cream border-l-4 border-brevo-green p-4 mt-4">
        <p className="text-sm font-semibold text-gray-dark mb-2">Why This Matters to You:</p>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-2">
          When you're evaluating tools or planning initiatives, knowing which type of AI you're using changes everything:
        </p>
        <ul className="text-sm space-y-1 text-gray-700 ml-4">
          <li>• <strong>ML-based tools</strong> → Great for optimization, require clean historical data, get better over time</li>
          <li>• <strong>GenAI tools</strong> → Great for creation, require good prompting, deliver immediate value</li>
          <li>• <strong>Predictive AI</strong> → Great for strategy, require data integration, drive high-level decisions</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">
          Most modern marketing AI stacks use all three in combination. Google Ads uses ML for bidding, GenAI for creative suggestions, and predictive AI for budget recommendations—all in one platform.

        "But we're doing fine without AI. Why rush?"
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">Fair question. Here are five reasons why waiting is more expensive than acting:</p>

      <div className="space-y-3">
        <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-4">
          <h5 className="font-semibold text-brevo-green mb-2">1. The Competitive Moat Is Being Built Right Now</h5>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-3">
            Your competitors aren't just using AI for efficiency—they're using it to create advantages you can't replicate later.
          </p>
          <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded">
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-2"><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
              A beauty brand uses AI to generate 1,000 variations of product descriptions, each optimized for different customer segments. They run A/B tests at a scale you can't match manually. They learn faster. They convert better. By the time you start, they're 18 months ahead in optimization data.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p className="text-sm font-semibold text-brevo-green mt-3">

          <h5 className="font-semibold text-brevo-green mb-2">2. Talent Expects It</h5>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
            Top marketers in 2025 won't join teams that don't use AI. It's like asking a designer to join a company that still uses MS Paint.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">
            If you want to attract and retain A-players, you need modern tools. Otherwise, you're fishing in a shrinking talent pool of people who haven't upskilled.

          <p className="text-sm font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-3">
            You can't deliver on these expectations manually. Your customers don't care that you're not using AI. They just know your competitor's experience is better.
